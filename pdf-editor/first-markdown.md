# Introduction 

This is my first markdown file. Here are somethings I can do with my first markdown file:

- I can also convert this to docx
- I can also convert this to powerpoint
- I can also convert this to pdf

# Math

This is the sample mean
$\bar{y}=\sum_{i=1}^n y_i$

# Picture

Figure \ref{ilex-vomitoria} is Yaupon Holy *Ilex Vomitoria*. It is native to North America and it makes a highly caffeinated tea with lots of antioxidants. It also has less tannins than traditional tea so it is less bitter. Despite it's pointed scientific name, I like it a whole lot.
